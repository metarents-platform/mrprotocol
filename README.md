**Protocol Golden Rules:**

- Maintaining Ownership;
- Minimize Blockchain transactions;
- Minimize User Interaction;
- Contracts should be limited to only their purpose and expected results;
- Synchronizing off-chain and on-chain data;
- Trustless & Collateral-free protocol.

**Protocol Design Improvements:**

- Leasing features & Recurring payments
- Implement native integration with Polygon L2 Scaling Layer;
- White label Integration layer: Metaverse developers to provide NFT monetization features to the entire NFT ecosystem.
- Designing a new EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) standard to make the MR protocol broadly integrated in the near future.
